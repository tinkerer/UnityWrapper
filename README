Unity Wrapper v1.01 Alpha
------------------------

Release Notes:
--------------
This is the new wrapper for Unity using the OpenNI and NITE .NET wrappers. 

This Unity + OpenNI/NITE integration is being created by Amir Hirsch (tinkerer on freenode and git). I copied most of the code out of the UserTracker.NET example code.

This release is not exactly at 100% working, though it seems to start up the sensor correctly. 

Unity seems to freeze every few times I run this.
